## UPLOAD X-RATED IMAGE (Exercise 4 of 9)

Use the `client` to upload an x-rated image, then delete that image.
You may upload an image file, a base64-encoded image, or an image url.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

```js
module.exports = async function (client) {
  // ...
}
```

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
