FIND SINGLE IMAGE (Exercise 3 of 9)

Use the client to find the image named "bravo".

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = async function (client) {
    
    // ...

    return {
      image: null
    };
  }

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
