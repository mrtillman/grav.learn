Use the client to determine how many email addresses
are associated with the Gravatar account.
Which email address is missing a primary image?

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = async function (client) {
    
    // ...

    return {
      emailAddressCount: 0,
      emailAddressMissingPrimaryImage: ""
    };
  }

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
