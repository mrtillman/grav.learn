Use the client to upload an image, then set it as primary.
Finally, get the primary image url.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = async function (client) {
    
    // ...

    return {
      primaryImageName: ""
    }
  }

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
