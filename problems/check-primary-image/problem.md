## CHECK PRIMARY IMAGE *(Exercise 0 of 9)*

Use the `client` to check if a primary image is set.

If a primary image is set, then remove it and check again.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

```js
const { GravatarClient } = require('grav.client');

module.exports = async function (client = new GravatarClient()) {
  // ...
}
```

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
